🖨️ Manage and view the status of 3D printers.  
👋 Custom profile system for UTDesign Makerspace members.  
✂️ Easy ways to paste snippets with useful information.

# Development

If you would like to contribute to BitBot, we ask that you are a student, staff, faculty, or alumni member of The University of Texas at Dallas. If you are, please join our [Discord server](https://utd.ms/discord) and contact an officer to get started and see what features our members are interested in. If you are not, we welcome any contributions to the project, but we ask that you contact us first to make sure that your feature is something that we would like to add.

You are also welcome to fork the project and make your own Discord bot for your own makerspace under the [MIT license](./LICENSE).
